# Security-System-in-Cpp
A Security System Project in C++ that includes registration, login, and change password involves creating a program that allows users to register for an account, login to their account, and change their password as needed using c++ programming language. Here's an overview of how the project might be structured:

* Define the data structure: First, you need to define the data structure of the system, which will include the user's information, such as name, email, password, etc. You can use a struct or class to represent each user.

* Implement registration: When a new user wants to register, the system should ask for their information and store it in a file or database. You can use file handling operations to create a new file for the user's information or append the information to an existing file. You can also use loops to keep asking for the user's information until they provide valid input.

* Implement login: When an existing user wants to log in, the system should ask for their email and password and check if they match the stored information. You can use file handling operations to read the user's information from the file and compare it with the input. If the login is successful, the system can grant access to other features, such as changing the password or accessing secure information.

* Implement change password: When a user wants to change their password, the system should ask for their current password and the new password. You can use file handling operations to update the user's information in the file with the new password. You can also use switch case statements to provide different options for the user, such as changing the password or canceling the operation.

* Implement other features: You can add other features to the system, such as displaying the user's information, logging out, or deleting the account. You can use switch case statements to provide different options for the user and loops to keep asking for input until the user provides valid input.
